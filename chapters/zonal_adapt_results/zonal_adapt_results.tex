\chapter{Adaptive LES}

In this chapter, we focus on applying the mesh adaptation strategies based on the VMS-based estimated error to large eddy simulation of flow over surging airfoil. A brief overview of the three strategies considered is mentioned in chapter \ref{sec:adapt_strat_overview}. We focus on applying these strategies to low Reynolds number case of $Re = 40, 000$ at an angle of attack of $\alpha = 6^\circ$ and advance ratio of $\mu_{sect} = 1.2$.

\section{Application of Zonal Adaptive/Refinement Strategy}
In chapter \ref{sec:adaptive_strategy_comparison}, we established that the zonal based refinement/adaptation is the best strategy for accurate numerical solution of periodic problems in space and time using VMS-based error estimator driven mesh adaptation. In this chapter, we focus on applying the zonal based adaptation/refinement strategy to different cases.

We explore mesh resolution effects in the in-plane and also in the spanwise direction. 
The run plan to achieve mesh convergence is as follows. 
We start off with a baseline mesh that satisfies LES surface resolution criteria for wall-bounded flows. This mesh is referred to as M0.
We obtain the maximum error over all phases through the surging cycle and also maximum in the spanwise direction.
The in-plane mesh is then refined by a factor of 2 in regions of high error zones, i.e., we employ the zonal-based adaptation/refinement strategy.
This resultant mesh is the in-plane mesh after the first adaptation cycle, which is referred to as Mza1.
Here, multiple spanwise resolutions are considered, starting with the spanwise resolution of M0 mesh, to obtain a series of meshes for Mza1 with different spanwise resolutions.
In this series of meshes, spanwise resolution is refined by a factor of 2, till spanwise convergence is achieved for this adaptation cycle. 
For the next adaptation cycle, zonal-based adaptation/refinement is again employed to refine the mesh in the in-plane direction, and the mesh with the second highest spanwise resolution of the previous adaptation cycle is used as the initial spanwise resolution for the current adaptation cycle. 
This mesh is referred to as Mza2.
Multiple spanwise resolutions are considered again for this adaptation cycle.
This process is repeated for further adaptation cycles till mesh convergence is achieved.

\section{ $Re=40,000$,  $\alpha=6^\circ$, $\mu_{sect}=1.2$}

In this section, we focus on applying the zonal based adaptation/refinement strategy to the low Reynolds number case of $Re=40,000$ at angle of attack $\alpha=6^\circ$ and advance ratio of $\mu_{sect}=1.2$ till we obtain mesh convergence.
We start with a baseline mesh that satisfies LES surface resolution criteria in wall plus units at maximum Reynolds number, which is achieved at $\psi=90^\circ$ (since relative velocity over the airfoil is maximum at this phase). 
This mesh is referred to as M0\_nz25, where nz25 refers to the number of extruded layers in the spanwise/z direction. Note that 25 extruded layers are used here since this corresponds to $\Delta z^+ = 40$ for this mesh.

Next, Mza1 series of meshes is obtained using zonal-based adaptation/refinement, and multiple spanwise resolutions are considered, starting with Mza1\_nz25, and refining by a factor of 2 in spanwise direction to get Mza1\_nz50 and Mza1\_nz100.
We observed that Mza1\_nz25 results compare well both Mza1\_nz50 and Mza1\_nz100 meshes.
Results for Mza1\_nz25 and Mza1\_nz50 meshes are shown in the following sections.
Results for Mza1\_nz100 are omitted for conciseness.

For the next adaptation cycle, Mza2 series of meshes is obtained by applying  zonal-based adaptation/refinement to Mza1\_nz25 mesh.
Initial spanwise resolution of Mza2\_nz25, i.e., 25 spanwise extruded layers is chosen, along with factor of 2 spanwise refinement to get Mza2\_nz50 and Mza2\_nz100 meshes. 
We observed that results from Mza2\_nz25 did not agree well with Mza2\_nz50 mesh, whereas Mza2\_nz50 and Mza2\_nz100 meshes showed good agreement.
Results for Mza2\_nz50 and Mza2\_nz100 meshes are shown in the following sections, while results for Mza2\_nz25 are omitted for conciseness.

For the next adaptation cycle, Mza3 series of meshes is obtained by applying  zonal-based adaptation/refinement to Mza2\_nz50 mesh. 
Initial spanwise resolution of Mza3\_nz50 is chosen, along with factor of 2 spanwise refinement to get Mza3\_nz100. 
We would like to note that Mza3\_nz200 mesh was not computationally feasible, so we stop at Mza3\_nz100.
Results for both Mza3\_nz50 and Mza3\_nz100 are shown in the following sections.
