\chapter{Results and Discussion: Zonal Based Adaptation/Refinement}

In chapter \ref{adapt_strat}, we established that the zonal based refinement/adaptation is the best strategy for computing accurate numerical solution using VMS-based error estimator driven mesh adaptation. In this chapter, we focus on applying the zonal based adaptation/refinement strategy to the low Reynolds number case of $Re=40,000$ at angle of attack $\alpha=6^\circ$ and advance ratio of $\mu_sect=1.2$ till we obtain mesh convergence. Here, we also perform an in-depth study of how spanwise resolution of the mesh affects the solution.

The nomenclature used for the different meshes, and mesh details are as follows:
