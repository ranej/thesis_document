The remainder of this thesis is organized as follows.
Chapter 2 discusses the dynamic LES methodology used in this work. 
Chapter 3 describes the VMS-based error estimator along with different mesh adaptation strategies.
Chapter 4 presents LES of flow over surging airfoil.
Chapter 5 discusses error-estimator driven adaptive LES of flow over surging airfoil.
Chapter 6 presents LES of flow over surging airfoils at very high advance ratios including active reflex camber.
Chapter 7 provides closing remarks and future work.
