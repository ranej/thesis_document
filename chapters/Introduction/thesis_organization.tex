Chapter 3 describes the VMS-based Error Estimator along with an overview of mesh adaptation strategies.
Chapter 4 discusses LES of flow over surging airfoil.
Chapter 5 presents error-estimator driven adaptive LES for flow over surging airfoil.
Chapter 6 discusses LES of flow over surging airfoils with active flow control applications in the form of active reflex camber.
Chapter 7 presents closing remarks and future work.
