In this strategy, mesh refinement is applied around dominant flow features of interest. 
In the surging airfoil case, LEV and TEV are the dominant flow features. 
Using vortex tracking, a path of the dominant vortices is estimated using an initial mesh (M0\_nz25 in this case). 
Based on this path, a refinement zone is added around the path of the LEV as well as the TEV. 
In this feature-based refinement, VMS-based estimated error is used to set the mesh size. 
In addition, estimated error is also used to refine the mesh around the airfoil in a similar fashion as the error-based zonal refinement discussed earlier. 
This is done to accurately resolve the flow near the airfoil, including the boundary layer region that plays a direct role in the formation of these dominant vortical structures/features.

Also note that the boundary layer mesh is refined by a factor of 2 in the streamwise direction, and the number of layers in the spanwise direction are doubled as compared to M0\_nz25.  
Vortex tracking discussed in Section \ref{sec:LEV} is used to estimate the path of the LEV and TEV. 
The mesh around the path of these vortical features is refined by a factor of 2, to accurately resolve the core of these vortices over its path. 
The mesh is referred to as Mfa1\_nz50 and it contains 2,777,750 elements, which is comparable to both Mza1\_nz50 and Msa1\_nz50.
This mesh is shown in Figure \ref{fig:FB_mesh} and the estimated error is shown in Figure \ref{fig:FB_error_plot}.

Error values are similar to Mza1\_nz50 closer to the airfoil surface, in the LEV path, and in the wake, since the mesh resolution in this region is similar.
Error values are lower as compared to Msa1\_nz50, since a uniform mesh size is maintained, as opposed to Msa1\_nz50, where the mesh size is patchy.
