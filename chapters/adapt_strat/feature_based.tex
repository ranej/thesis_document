In this strategy, mesh refinement is applied around dominant flow features of interest. In the surging airfoil case, LEV and TEV are the dominant flow features. Using vortex tracking, a path of the dominant vortices is estimated using an initial mesh (M0 in this case). Based on this path, a refinement zone is added around the path of the LEV as well as the TEV. In this feature-based refinement, VMS-based estimated error is used to set the mesh size. In addition, estimated error is also used to refine the mesh around the airfoil in a similar fashion as the error-based zonal refinement discussed earlier. This is done to accurately resolve the flow near the airfoil, including the boundary layer region that plays a direct role in the formation of these dominant vortical structures/features.

Also note that the boundary layer mesh is refined by a factor of 2 in the streamwise direction, and the number of layers in the spanwise direction are doubled as compared to M0.  
Vortex tracking discussed in Section \ref{sec:LEV} is used to estimate the path of the LEV and TEV. The mesh around the path of these vortical features is refined by a factor of 4, to accurately resolve the core of these vortices over its path. 
The mesh is referred to as Mf\_a1 and it contains 3,454,450 elements.
This mesh is shown in Figure \ref{fig:FB_mesh} and the estimated error is shown in Figure \ref{fig:FB_error_plot}.

Error values along the LEV path are reduced as compared to Ms\_a1. Even though the mesh resolution in the LEV region is similar to Mz\_a2, higher error is observed as compared to Mz\_a2, since the mesh resolution over the airfoil surface is coarser for Mf\_a1 as compared to Mz\_a2.
