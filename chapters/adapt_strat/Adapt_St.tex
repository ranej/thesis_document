Here, a comparison of adaptive strategies is performed for the $Re=40,000$ case.
%, at advance ratio of $\mu_{sect}=1.2$, at an angle of attack of $\alpha=6^\circ$.
The three VMS-based error estimator driven mesh adaptation strategies considered here are zonal-based refinement, nodal size field-based adaptation, and feature-based refinement. Phase-averaged flow data is used, and the maximum local error taken over multiple phases and over the spanwise direction is used as a representation for the entire surging cycle. In particular, we consider 24 phases that are regularly spaced over the cycle and includes the end of the cycle.
