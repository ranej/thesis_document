We are interested in applying the VMS-based error estimator to periodic problems in space and/or time. The specific problem of interest in this case is flow over a surging airfoil. In this case, an airfoil oscillates sinusoidally in a constant freestream and is also periodic in the spanwise direction. The mesh for this case is first generated as a 2D/in-plane mesh (i.e., on the front surface), and then extrusion is applied in the spanwise direction.

Currently, an adapted mesh is constructed for the entire surging cycle since we are interested in turbulent flows with resolution of fine-scale structures/fluctuations and adapting at different time steps over an oscillation cycle can be computationally expensive. Thus, the VMS-based error estimator is applied to phase-averaged data and multiple instances/phases over the surging cycle, and the maximum local/elemental error over the surging cycle are chosen. The selected phases are typically regularly spaced over the cycle, e.g., 24 phases at every $15^\circ$ including the end of the cycle. Similarly, for a spanwise extruded mesh, the maximum local/elemental error in the spanwise direction over the extruded-stack of elements is selected.
