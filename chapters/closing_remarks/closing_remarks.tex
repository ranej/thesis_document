\chapter{Closing Remarks and Future Work}

This thesis focused on developing error estimator driven adaptive mesh refinement strategies and applying them to LES unsteady aerodynamic flows.
Three adaptive strategies were developed and applied: zonal refinement, size field-based adaptation, and
feature-based refinement. This was done in a variational multiscale (VMS) based finite element framework.

Applied to a specific problem of interest: Surging Airfoil.

Zonal-based refinement was applied to LES of flow over Re=40,000...
Feature-based refinement can be used for higher advance ratios and other types of flows.

Mesh convergence is shown.

A higher Re=200,000 is also considered.

Active reflex camber is applied and drag reduction is shown.
